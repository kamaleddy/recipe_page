Working with different content types - from lists to tables to images - gave me experience in structuring varied content effectively.

```css
table {
  width: 100%;
  border-collapse: collapse;
}

section li::marker {
  color: var(--title-color-for-section);
  font-weight: 700;
}
```

### Continued development

Enhancing this project with JavaScript interactivity, like adding a cooking timer, ingredient checklist, or dark mode toggle, while also improving accessibility with ARIA labels and focus states.

### Useful resources
